This adds checked versions of a number of common unchecked exceptions we have.

We can add these temporaily as we don't expect developers to be force to handle these exceptions but we want to ensure

- we want handle these correctly in our code.
- we want handle these consistently with the right exception and making these checked helps review the choices made.
- we want to document when these unchecked exceptions can/cannot occur.
